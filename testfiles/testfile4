It is from this point of view that we can understand the famous Scholastic
argument according to which there is a vicious circle in every proposition
which concerns being, since any judgment about bcing already
implies being. But in actuality there is no vicious circle, for it is not
necessary again to pass beyond the being of this meaning toward its meaning;
the meaning of being is valid for the being of every phenomenon,
including its own being. The phenomenon of being is not being, as we
have already noted. But it indicates being and requires it-although, in
truth, the ontological proof which we mentioned above is not valid
especiaIIy or uniquely for it; there is one ontological proof valid for the
whole domain of consciousness. But this proof is sufficient to justify all
the information which we can derive from the phenomenon of being.
The phcnomenon of being, like every primary phenomenon, is immediately
disclosed to consciousness. We have at each instant what Heidegger
calls a pre-ontological comprehension of it; that is, one which is not accompanied
by a fixing in concepts and elucidation. For us at present, then,
there is no question of considering this phenomenon for the sake of trying
to fix the meaning of being. We must observe always:
(1) That this elucidation of the meaning of being is valid.
